					<h4>What is this about?</h4>
					<p class="paragraph-text"> My name is Carlien Ostermeier and I have done a lot with regard to studying. I started my undergrad with Pedagogical Sciences with a minor in Governance and Organisational Sciences. Thereafter, I did the Pre-masters course Business Administration at the University of Amsterdam and am currently doing a master in Human Resource Management and Organisational Analysis at King's College in London. I found out that no matter what subject I did, studying itself did not change. It always ends up with having to sit and work through the material. </p>
					<p class="paragraph-text">  There are these days that you are in the flow and everything seems to go naturally. You keep turning pages and it seems like your brain has changed into a big sponge that takes in all the information. Until the moment you take a break ... The hyper focus of the study seems to switch to a hyper focus on your phone or computer. You seem to fly through the levels of your game and the movies you are referred to seem to be made especially for you. And before you know it you are one hour further, while you had agreed with yourself that you would take a 15-minute break. </p>
					<p class="paragraph-text"> I myself have often experienced this and when I took coding classes, I decided that I would like to change this and want to help others by sharing this website to help others to take responsible and fun breaks but also get to their graduation as stress-free as possible. </p>
